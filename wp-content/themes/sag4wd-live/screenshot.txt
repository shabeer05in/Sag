This is a placeholder for screenshot.png
WordPress themes typically include a screenshot.png (880x660px recommended) 
that shows a preview of the theme in the Appearance > Themes panel.

To add a screenshot:
1. Create a 880x660px PNG image showing your theme's homepage
2. Save it as screenshot.png in this directory
